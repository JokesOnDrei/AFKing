# AFKing

AFKing is a tiny Python script that keeps your screen and status active by wiggling your mouse every few seconds!<br>
Perfect for anyone who does "Work From Bali" — or maybe just away from their desk<br><br>
Press Esc three times to make it stop… or when your boss walks by 👀

## 🛠️ What It Does
- Random mouse movement across your screen
- Stops safely with triple `Esc` press
- Cross-platform compatible (tested on macOS & Windows)

## 📦 What It Needs

## 🕹️ How to Use This Thing	

### 🔧 One-time Setup (First Time Only)

```bash
# 1. Clone (download) the project from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/JokesOnDrei/AFKing.git

# 2. Move into the project folder
cd AFKing
